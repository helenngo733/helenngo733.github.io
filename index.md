### CPSC 120

* Lab 12

    Lab 12, part 1 is my most favorite lab I have done because Iâ€™ve always been interested in the process of making animation and gifs. I also enjoyed working with codes that deal with colors and images. In this lab, I was able to learn how to create a function that generates a series of images and stores them in the std::vector. Using automated unit testing has also helped save time and make the programming a better experience.

* Lab 8 

    Lab 8, part 2 is my second favorite lab because the program calls for the user to enter a message which will then be saved into another file. It's cool to see how this is similar to google docs or emails that get saved after typing something into a document. I learn to write function definitions that use std::ofstream and std::getline() in order to open files for reading and writing.

* Lab 5

    Lab 5, part 1 is my third favorite lab because I wanted to know how a program calls for the user to enter fill-in blanks that create a sentence. This is similar to what we did in Lab 3 but instead of using cin in the functions, the program will read from the command line arguments. For the first time, I learned to understand how to use std::vectors and std::string to initialize arguments and output a sandwich order.
